guide to using our kanban project management tool.\n    Here, we'll provide an overview of what Join is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.\n  \n\n  \n    What is Join?\n    \n      Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated\n      students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.\n    \n    \n      Kanban, a Japanese term meaning \"billboard\", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit\n      work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). Join leverages the principles of kanban to help users\n      manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.\n    \n    \n      It is important to note that Join is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive\n      business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent\n      availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding Join.\n    \n  \n\n  \n    How to use it\n    \n      \n        1. Exploring the Board\n        \n          In order to use the board, you need to log in first. You can either register or use the guest log in account. When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board. \n          This board represents your project and contains four default lists: To Do, In Progress, Await feedback and Done.\n        \n      \n      \n        2. Creating Contacts\n        \n          In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the Contacts section,\n          click on New contact, and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board. \n          If you are logged in with your personal account, you will find yourself as a contact within the contact list.\n        \n      \n      \n        3. Adding Cards\n        \n          Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding new cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click the\n          \"+\" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details, like task\n          name, description, due date, assignees, etc.\n        \n      \n      \n        4. Moving Cards\n        \n          As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping the\n          card from one list to another. On mobile devices each card has an additional menu option, where you can assign tasks to specific stages \n          in the board by clicking the \"...\" button.\n        \n      \n      \n        5.

Here, we\\'ll provide an overview of what Join is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.        What is Join?          Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated      students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.              Kanban, a Japanese term meaning \"billboard\", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit      work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). Join leverages the principles of kanban to help users      manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.              It is important to note that Join is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive      business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent      availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding Join.            How to use it                  1. Exploring the Board                  In order to use the board, you need to log in first. You can either register or use the guest log in account. When you log in to Join, you\\'ll find a default board.           This board represents your project and contains four default lists: To Do, In Progress, Await feedback and Done.                            2. Creating Contacts                  In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the Contacts section,          click on New contact, and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.           If you are logged in with your personal account, you will find yourself as a contact within the contact list.                            3. Adding Cards                  Now that you\\'ve added your contacts, you can start adding new cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click the          \"+\" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details, like task          name, description, due date, assignees, etc.                            4. Moving Cards                  As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping the          card from one list to another. On mobile devices each card has an additional menu option, where you can assign tasks to specific stages           in the board by clicking the \"...\" button.                            5. Deleting Cards                  Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the Done list or delete it. Deleting a card will          permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is          irreversible.                            Remember that using Join effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board      reflects the current state of your project.            Still have questions?

generated using Angular CLI version 19.2.12.\nDevelopment server\nTo start a local development server, run:\nExample :ng serveOnce the server is running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nAngular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:\nExample :ng generate component component-nameFor a complete list of available schematics (such as components, directives, or pipes), run:\nExample :ng generate --helpBuilding\nTo build the project run:\nExample :ng buildThis will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the dist/ directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.\nRunning unit tests\nTo execute unit tests with the Karma test runner, use the following command:\nExample :ng testRunning end-to-end tests\nFor end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:\nExample :ng e2eAngular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.\nAdditional Resources\nFor more information on using the Angular CLI, including detailed command references, visit the Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules - modules","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n    Modules\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"overview.html":{"url":"overview.html","title":"overview - overview","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n    Overview\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    19 Components\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    11 Injectables\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    1 Guard\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    7 Interfaces\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"properties.html":{"url":"properties.html","title":"package-properties - properties","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Properties\n    \n    \n        \n            Version : 0.0.0\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"miscellaneous/variables.html":{"url":"miscellaneous/variables.html","title":"miscellaneous-variables - variables","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Miscellaneous\n  Variables\n\n\n\n    Index\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            appConfig   (src/.../app.config.ts)\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    src/app/app.config.ts\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        appConfig\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Type :     ApplicationConfig\n\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Default value : {\n  providers: [\n    provideZoneChangeDetection({ eventCoalescing: true }),\n    provideRouter(routes, withHashLocation()),\n    provideFirebaseApp(() =>\n      initializeApp({\n        projectId: 'join-6125f',\n        appId: '1:703986298510:web:8cb9707daf583f2153a3df',\n        storageBucket: 'join-6125f.firebasestorage.app',\n        apiKey: 'AIzaSyAWyoU260eXmo3445mLTsqCjzRhEG6aq9A',\n        authDomain: 'join-6125f.firebaseapp.com',\n        messagingSenderId: '703986298510',\n      })\n    ),\n    provideFirestore(() => getFirestore()),\n    provideAnimations(),\n    provideAuth(() => getAuth()),\n    {\n      provide: CDK_DRAG_CONFIG,\n      useValue: {\n        dragStartThreshold: 5,\n        pointerDirectionChangeThreshold: 5,\n        zIndex: 1000,\n        scrollSpeed: 30,          \n        scrollProximity: 100,\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n}\n                    \n                \n\n\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
